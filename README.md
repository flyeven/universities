# universities
Contains most of the universities in the world in multiple data formats (including CSV and JSON)

Edit/add parsers if you want to change the output-format/output-file. 

validCheck.rb is used to cycle through the data and check that it is all valid (all fields are != "" && != nil)
Change this file if you have more/less validations for your application
